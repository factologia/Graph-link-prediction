## Code

The code is in a Jupyter notebook, `Kaggle challenge - Main notebook.ipynb`.

You will get an assertion error in the last (CNN) section: this is intended as a way to stop execution, as the final model we used is placed just before the CNN part. In other words, you can just ignore the CNN cells (or you can take a look at it, to see what we have been experimenting with!).

The output file is named `out.csv`, and is generated at the end of the "4.5 Final model - output" section.

## Data

Data should be placed in a `data` folder. You need the following file organisation to get the notebook to run properly:

- Kaggle challenge - Main notebook.ipynb
- data
  - testing_set.txt
  - training_set.txt
  - node_information.csv
